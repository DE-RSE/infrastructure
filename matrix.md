# Matrix Chat

We use the [Matrix](https://matrix.org) protocol for asynchronous communication.

We manage a [space](https://matrix.to/#/#de-rse.org:matrix.org) on the matrix.org server, which serves as a container for de-RSE related rooms.

Which rooms are suggested to those joining the space is decided by the de-RSE moderator team.

All public rooms in our space have to abide by the following rules, as documented on [our webpage](https://de-rse.org/de/matrix.html).

There is a set of rooms that is moderated by a team of the association.
Their names start withe the prefix `deRSE-` and use the de-RSE logo.
The list of rooms is documented on [our webpage](https://de-rse.org/de/matrix.html).

Community members can add rooms of their own, given they follow a set of rules as documented on [our webpage](https://de-rse.org/de/matrix.html).
