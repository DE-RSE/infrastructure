# Matrix Chat

We use the [Matrix](https://matrix.org) protocol for asynchronous communication.

We manage a [space](https://matrix.to/#/#de-rse.org:matrix.org) on the matrix.org server, which serves as a container for de-RSE related rooms.

Which rooms are suggested to those joining the space is decided by the de-RSE moderator team.

All rooms in our space have to abide by the following rules:

- The functional account @de-rse:matrix.org must be added as an admin.
- Rooms must not be encrypted and the history should be readable by joining users.
  We want newcomers to be able to join ongoing discussions.
- Every room should have a logo.
  You can use the de-RSE logo as a default, if you have nothing better.

There is a set of rooms that is moderated by a team of the association.
Their names start withe the prefix `deRSE-` and use the de-RSE logo.

deRSE-general
: For general discussions that are de-RSE related, but fit in no other room.
deRSE-introductions
: For (new) community members introducing themselves.
deRSE-jobs
: For RSE related job announcements from the community.
deRSE-events
: For RSE related event announcements from the community.
deRSE-off-topic
: For anything not related to de-RSE, but that one might want to discuss with the de-RSE community.

Community members can add rooms of their own, given they follow a set of rules.
If you add a room for a de-RSE chapter, use the prefix `deRSE-chapter-`.
In addition to the functional account that has to be added, a user must have the moderator role.
